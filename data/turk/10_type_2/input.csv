Zionist jews and their supporters were responsible for Palestinian suffering. But the jews have violently determined the fate of Palestinian people and they were and still responsible for their misery and suffering. Palestinian next generations will remember and will never forget or forgive.,palestinian suffering,0,2
"Zimbalist tortuously describes distinctions without differences to arrive at his unwarranted conclusion. If we are taxing corporations, none should be tax-exempt. Period! The tax code is to raise revenue, not to institute social policies. Those, if deemed desirable, should be done through appropriations, where our representatives will have to justify their choices with each budget. Unfortunately, the tax code is much like military bases, pork spread so widely that no one wants to rock the boat, even if the totality is detrimental to the welfare of our country.",tax,1,2
"You're going to have a hard time eating (at least enjoying) a purely vegan diet without processing tools. Fruits, nuts, and raw vegetables all the time? No soy milk? No tofu? No vegetable oil? No corn or wheat flour? This person makes a completely specious argument.",processed foods,1,2
"YES. The other way some of them cherry pick is through their faux lotteries. At Success, the first round of the lottery uses a computer algorithm to choose kids; when those families decline or are found ineligible, Success doesn't have to blindly choose anymore - they can go into the 'wait list' pool and select the kids they think will have the fewest academic, behavioral, language, or special needs issues.",acceptance lotteries,0,2
"Yes, we have ""a generation of illiterates and dumbells..."" I have to attempt to teach them. They aren't illiterate because the school system is broken, they are lazy, pampered, and spoiled--at home. Do they really expect a teacher to create a different lesson for kids because the parents don't like the content? When are they going to do this, before or after they create lessons for all of the special ed kids that that the law says must be ""mainstreamed"" into classes that are over their heads? When they are creating science lessons that must incorporate math, reading, arts, and practical living? What are the other students going to do while the teacher is teaching all of this alternative material? I WISH more parents had a clue what was going on in the school, but they need to work with the system, not against it. Like the author, if my parent didn't want me to hear, see, or do what what was going on in class, I left the room, went to the library, etc. We need to get over claiming our ""rights"" and pay attention to what is really important to society.",special needs,0,2
"Wrong! Two reasons. One, Malthusianism does not hold, since resource production can go up exponentially too. Two, the population will peak out at 12-15 billion or so, when it will start to shrink, as it has been doing in Europe for decades now. Uncontrolled extrapolation is a trap to avoid.",malthusianism,0,2
"Wow, the war on drugs. People were smoking marijuana for ten thousand years before it was outlawed here in the 1930s. Why was it outlawed? Short answer to a complex question: Randolph Hearst owned timber he wanted to sell for newspaper pulp, his main competitor? Hemp, or marijuana, so he funded and campaign for its end as a legal product in the US. We see how the drug war has ended. Your reasoning could be applied to breast milk, most people had some, and some of them became addicts. In my view addiction is simply in a person's chemistry and some are susceptible, most people are not. As you can tell, I disagree entirely with your thesis, although I like alcohol myself. us army 1969-1971/california jd",marijuana,1,2
"Worldwide, there is a direct correlation between the average educational level of a country's women and its birth rate. In countries where the average woman has at least the equivalent of a high school education, birth rates are low, below replacement level in some cases. In countries where the average woman is illiterate, birth rates are the highest in the world, partly because such countries allow no way for women to gain status except by bearing a lot of children, preferably sons. Within individual countries, educated women have fewer children than uneducated ones. Encourage education for women and girls, make access to birth control easy and inexpensive, and population growth will level off.",woman education as useful for controlling population growth,1,2
"Without relevant travel, learning a language neither occurs nor is relevant to later life. Let's require a semester abroad or gap year to go with that language requirement. And let's fund it so it is not only the rich who benefit.",learning a language,1,2
"With regard to the assertion that larger airplanes carrying more people will accommodate higher passenger volumes as opposed to more flights (and runways) for conventional aircraft (737s, etc.), not so. An Airbus 380 or Boeing 787 cannot be economically operated between San Francisco and LA at prices and costs competitive with smaller passenger planes. Hence, without relieving SF-LA air traffic with high speed rail, our airspace will not be able to handle the traffic. Already a quarter of intra-state flights are late due to air congestion.",high speed rail,1,2
