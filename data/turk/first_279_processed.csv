vaccination,"We still haven't addressed the problem of children who come from other countries into America and have not had the advantage of early childhood vaccinations. We are seeing cases of measles, mumps, etc. increase, and this cannot be all the fault of those who have lived with and been in contact daily in this country since birth with their peers who have been vaccinated. I'm old, and when in 1st grade, I contacted German measles. NOT from someone in my class and, in fact, no one seemed to know where I contacted it. I then proceeded to infect almost all my entire class apparently. My point in telling this story is that we cannot know exactly where a child gets his contact, and therefore IMO opinion, vaccinations should be mandatory for every child entering schools from pre-K up. Until everyone - from the child who comes with their parents to America to the kiddo next door, we have to be consistent.",1,"We still have n't addressed the problem of children who come from other countries into America and have not had the advantage of early childhood vaccinations .

home schoolers,"Bruce S.

Public education must plan and staff to educate _every_ child in the district.

Writing a Wikipedia article seems a simple task, it is a very challenging work because first of all it is an hypertext and references, quotations, link are central to prove both the entry is verifiable and well structured. Second, editors review all articles that are submitted and there is a group approval system to determine if content is published, or rejected in the case of plagiarism or poor quality.",1,"I personally think that using arguments and evidence is central in any debate .

So not only did JPM not control its own traders, it was in the dark about what they were doing. And this was AFTER Dodd-Frank took effect. A bank with lax internal controls cannot overcome the weakness simply be getting so big that it can afford the resulting losses.

Are the rich supposed to be exempt from taxation ? They depend on society to produce their riches . In late - Victorian Britain , the argument was the opposite . Non - work income was ' unearned income ' and was taxed at a higher rate . And spare us the argument that low taxes on capital gains promotes economic growth . Under low capital gains tax ( since the 1980s ) growth was slower than in the post - war periods , when taxes were high . And virtually all the benefits of growth have gone to the rich .",6699

Ours is not a national capital like London, Paris, or Berlin. We are a business city and have to generate as well as spend money. NY has been very good at both things for many decades.

a useful excercise for college students,"""Are research papers a waste of time?"" Absolutely not! The internet may give students and scholars easy access to sources, but many of these sources are flawed or unreliable in some way. Now more than ever, students need to know how to sift through information to find reliable sources and well-constructed arguments. Writing a research paper is still the best way to do this. Select a paper topic that you find interesting or important. Read and evaluate 10-15 reputable sources related to your topic, and then build an argument that engages with and contributes to this existing research. This might not be the most exciting assignment in the world (depends on the topic, I suppose) but it teaches skills that every college graduate should have. Really, every high school graduate ought to have this training as well. But let's not ask for the moon!",1,""" Are research papers a waste of time ? "" Absolutely not !

Financial companies drive the economy into the Great Recession . Airlines have no regard for the people they transport . As long as they make a profit , they are allowed to abuse the public until they are stopped . That is the way it has been since Swift and Armour canned and sold rotten meat and Carnegie sent Pinkertons to shoot striking miners .",368
research papers,"""Are research papers a waste of time?"" Absolutely not! The internet may give students and scholars easy access to sources, but many of these sources are flawed or unreliable in some way. Now more than ever, students need to know how to sift through information to find reliable sources and well-constructed arguments. Writing a research paper is still the best way to do this. Select a paper topic that you find interesting or important. Read and evaluate 10-15 reputable sources related to your topic, and then build an argument that engages with and contributes to this existing research. This might not be the most exciting assignment in the world (depends on the topic, I suppose) but it teaches skills that every college graduate should have. Really, every high school graduate ought to have this training as well. But let's not ask for the moon!",1,""" Are research papers a waste of time ? "" Absolutely not !

miss america,"Most of the smartest women I know aren't competing in pageants...and the opportunities these pageants provide in cash for a few women do not undue the harm that they cause for the millions of others that watch. The only 'brainy' thing the women do on stage is anwser a one-line question. Even the volunteering component is still a bit silly. Given that volunteering is now a pre-req for college admissions, these women don't achieve much more than their peers do.

miss america,"Splendid. Martin is right when she points out that beauty is complex and highly individual. Beauty contests are yet another way corporations manipulate us into thinking that beauty is something we can buy only if we buy their products. How many beauty contest winners publish novels, make scientific discoveries, or sit in board rooms? Perhaps there is a better way to invest $50,000 in scholarship money than to give it to the person who looks best in a bikini.",0,"Splendid .
