The business of NY is real estate and the banks that finance it. Much like the business of Washington is government and the business of Las Vegas is gambling. Real Estate taxes and the revenues that come from the construction of new buildings is the lifeblood of the city. It has been that way for at least two hundred years. Ours is not a national capital like London, Paris, or Berlin. We are a business city and have to generate as well as spend money. NY has been very good at both things for many decades. The idea that somehow real estate interests are out of control or taking over how the city is run is perhaps news for 1815, not 2015. Without the millionaires and billionaires building and buying these fancy new places, New York would be Philadelphia. Philadelphia is a lovely place and if you prefer it, you should seriously consider moving there because NY is never going to be Philadelphia.",1,"I am surprised by the naivete of many commenters and even some contributors .

After years as a vegan (and the dangerously low cholesterol levels that came with it), I couldn't agree more that humans are omnivores by design. No doubt many of us don't get enough veggies, but that's not justification for ignoring our ancestry and anatomy/physiology. As a Naturopathic Doctor with years of clinical and research experience, I have a sound understanding of human nutrition. The bottom line is that there exists no sound argument that humans are designed to be strict plant eaters. In fact, everything from our teeth to the other end of our digestive tract suggests that we are, and have always been, omnivores.

If we are going to subsidize preschool or child care, why not also subsidize parents who want to stay home with their children but can't afford to? We are constantly being urged to copy European measures to provide care for children outside the home, but we are never urged to follow the example of Finland, France, Norway, Belgium and Austria by also providing parental home-care allowances. Why the selectivity? I am afraid it is because while feminism claims to oppose our tendency to hold the work of childcare in low regard - a tendency which predates second-wave feminism - it has done virtually nothing to correct that prejudice. Instead it supports an everybody-into-the-workforce ideology which in turn relies on the availability of underpaid childcare.",1,"I would like to suggest an additional choice .

It was interesting - at same time my sister was photographed at a ""Ban the Ball"" demo at the UofC campus. The purpose of higher education is, in large part, teaching a young person how to approach learning and apply that learning to life as it unfolds. Sports on an intramural level or low key interscholastic plane have a place - but not the spectacle of college sports serving as the training ground for professional teams. I always cringe when Americans justify marginal enterprises, products that really shouldn't exist, extreme sports, etc. with the usual ""but some people make a lot of money doing it"".
