Flinging around statistics about the average per pupil cost of public education is not the same thing as providing evidence that private or home education reduce the necessary expenditures of public school systems. Can anyone cite any tax bill which was reduced when when parochial schools closed? Mary Askew",0,9237,"Bruce S. Cooper 's reasoning lacks supporting evidence : home - schooling parents do not save the taxpayers any money just as parents ' whose ill children miss several days of public school do not save taxpayers money . Nor do parents who send their children to parochial schools save tax dollars . Public schools still have to be built , maintained and staffed regardless of whether some families keep its children at home or choose to send their children to private or parochial schools . Public education must plan and staff to educate _ every _ child in the district . I have yet to see any empirical evidence to support the idea that home - schooling or private or religious schools save the taxpayers ' money .

Then we got further statements from the current - day Republicans that "" job creators are on strike "" . Well , they 've not been using their tax savings to hire the rest of us . Reagan fired strikers , yet this time we 're expected to reward them even more ? Tax cuts and deals for those who can afford to get most of their income from investing seems to prove one thing - they do n't circulate as much of their income as the rest of us do . From the way things are running this far in to Bush 's "" temporary "" tax cuts all I can picture is a series of mansions with mattresses high in the air over all that frozen cash . Face it , Mr. Miron . There 's no tax bar so low that some of the wealthy would n't pay bright people to find somewhere else with a lower rate . I 'm picturing a land of negative taxation , and there they 'd probably say they needed to be paid more by the populace .",taxing capital gains,,A2WPHVMLLEV5ZB

What we see here is a call for permanent retribution, no matter the crime.",1,16798,"So this thesis is "" Once a felon , always a felon ? "" The stated purpose of incarceration correction . In California it is the CDC or California Department of Corrections , not the prison department . A convict is released , put on parole , satisfies the requirements , and is expected to become a normal member of society . But at the same time loses certain right that other citizens have . He / she is in effect no longer a whole citizen , even after having paid satisfied the conditions imposed by the court . So even though his behavior has been corrected he / she is treated as uncorrected . Worse yet , in many cases they can not get certain work , are relegated to the lower levels of society , yet expected to be productive . So what is the purpose of conviction and incarceration ? Some may be career criminals , but as we have seen fr to many times , most are not , but in many cases return to crime as that is what they know best .
