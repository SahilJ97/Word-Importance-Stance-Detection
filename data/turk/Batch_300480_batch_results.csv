The TFA alumni who leave teaching for other careers retain their knowledge of the real conditions of poor children and their schools. They can and do give voice to those realities in political debates and can counter the many (often willfully) ignorant claims of opponents of public education. Just as Peace Corp volunteers are a source of reality about the Third World, so TFA alumni can and do continue to advocate for poor children and their schools when they become investment bankers, lawyers, or other high earners. Such advocacy doesn't direct benefit the children they taught, but it will benefit public education. TFA recognizes that we need to change the political debate over public education as much as we need to get top graduates into schools as teachers. Rather than harp on the limits of TFA, we should recognize that Wendy Kopp has found a way to move politics in a progressive direction and spend our efforts applying its lessons to other areas of public policy and politics.","One of the most important contributions to US education from TFA alumni has not been mentioned by any of the contributors to this discussion .
