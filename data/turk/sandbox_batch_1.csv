kids,"""One size does not fit all"" is a good sound byte. And trying to make students learn about and take an interest in subjects in which they have little or no interest is difficult. But allowing students to choose to be ignorant by only studying what they want to study is just sheer stupidity. We Americans are already THE most illiterate and ignorant bunch of ""educated"" human beings on the planet. But countries like Russia and China are certainly pleased with ""It's your right ot can be as stupid and ignorant as you want to"" mentality.",""" One size does not fit all "" is a good sound byte .

prostituion,"We've seen how a wild west approach with no laws works - abused children and adults get exploited. At least with a legal system there are some checks and balances to protect the workers, satisfy demand, and ensure a safe work environment for adults. With a legal path, there's an incentive to play by the rules. Those who continue to operate outside of the laws - the traffickers and child abusers - have less cover from the laws and those who enforce them.","We 've seen how a wild west approach with no laws works - abused children and adults get exploited .

public workers,"Businesses - big and small - increasingly have a greater say in how the country is run and how we are supposed to live our lives, which I find appalling. A corporate employer can spend exorbitant amounts of money to further trample the civil rights of millions of American LGBT citizens, but can also squash dissent in employees by threatening free speech with termination of employment, which is getting harder and harder to find these days since business won't hire american citizens unless Big/Small Business can be excused from paying taxes to the country whose liberal regulation allowed them such record breaking profits in the first place. A waitress in a restaurant in South (possibly North) Carolina was fired for ridiculing P.I.A customers from her previous shift on her personal facebook page. Speaking out against a company you work for, even in this country (USA), can also lead to immediate termination. Michael Moore stated in his film, Capitalism: A Love Story, that in order to have a true democracy, we the people must have a voice in the workplace and how it's run (same for the financial system), and I agree whole-heartedly.","Businesses - big and small - increasingly have a greater say in how the country is run and how we are supposed to live our lives , which I find appalling .

school librarians,"As a school librarian who enjoys working with our local public library system, I think there is a lot to be said for looking at ways for the two to work together more closely to best serve our students, not as a cost-saving measure. Can we deliver better service and aid student achievement by joining up more effectively? But while there is overlap in the goals of public and school libraries, they have a different focus in their staffing and services. In addition, as teachers are asked to do more and more, a school librarian is able to support THEIR training needs and those of students to provide instruction and resources that match their curricular needs. The school librarian provides a fantastic value, reaching every single child and staff member in a school - every program, teacher, administrator, and students of every background and ability are served. Talk about bang for your buck!","As a school librarian who enjoys working with our local public library system , I think there is a lot to be said for looking at ways for the two to work together more closely to best serve our students , not as a cost - saving measure .

a gamble,"i go to Aqueduct Casino often, as well as Yonkers, and i see pensioneers, and to my eye apparently people with little disposable income. the surrounding areas of these facilities don't seem to have prospered, similar to AC's situation. there's 2 casinos in local area and i think that's enough to lure those who want to gamble.","i go to Aqueduct Casino often , as well as Yonkers , and i see pensioneers , and to my eye apparently people with little disposable income . the surrounding areas of these facilities do n't seem to have prospered , similar to AC 's situation . there 's 2 casinos in local area and i think that 's enough to lure those who want to gamble .",0

motherhood,"I adopted at 40 and have no regrets. But I do wish sometimes that I had the strength I used to have a decade back. A late child allowed me to enjoy my career, travel the world and see all kinds of late night movies/plays and do trekking and a lot of other stuff that a lot of my friends just could not do because they were stuck at home with their babies. So, yes - delaying a baby definitely worked for me. My friends are now sending their kids off to college while I'm still teaching addition n subtraction - true. But I'm a happier person and a better mom because I'm not resenting my kid as the reason for not fulfilling my career ambitions or not having enjoyed my own space.","I adopted at 40 and have no regrets .

capital gains,"When capital gains resulted in true investment, the argument that lowering it spurred economic grow for our nation made some sense. But capital gains in the 21st century arises much more from gambling. Trading equities in micro seconds, electronic trading that churns thousands of shares a second, looking only at todays, or even only at this minutes gain in the is not investment. Such activity isn't based on searching for companies that will do well in the long haul. Even management of pension funds and IRAs is done primarily for the fees charged by the investment managers who don't care it the funds go up or down, only if they get their piece. So actually capital gains tax rate should not be reduced or eliminated. It should be raised to the same rate charde on gasmbling monies sine it is now exactly the same.","When capital gains resulted in true investment , the argument that lowering it spurred economic grow for our nation made some sense .

a legitimate threat,"All six commentators make valid points. But I'm struck by the fact that none of them discuss the injustice of human beings monopolizing so large a percentage of Earth's habitat and resources, or the resulting ongoing mass extinction of Earth's species. If a particular nation or people were aggressively displacing other nations and peoples, overrunning their land and taking their resources, leaving these others displaced, diminished, even completely exterminated, the world would have no problem calling this behavior by its proper name: genocidal warfare. The modern endless growth economy--dedicated to making ever more people ever wealthier--is interspecies genocide. Its time we ended our war on nature and accepted limits to human numbers and human economic demands.","All six commentators make valid points .

extreme parenting,"no extreme parenting does not work. Balance is the key. Whatever style a parent engages in with his/her child, a balanced point of view is preferred.

farms,"I find it hard to believe that Dr. Roberts is a Southerner; if he were he might realize how many of the arguments used to justify the need for illegal labor are so eerily similar to those that were used to justify our own peculiar institution 150  years ago. This does not make American agricultural interests any more evil than antebellum white Southerns were; just shortsighted and maybe a little mule-headed, like Southerners were and often still are. My advice to the American agriculture industry is to look down the road at how you will be viewed decades from now and get on the right side of history while you can.","I find it hard to believe that Dr. Roberts is a Southerner ; if he were he might realize how many of the arguments used to justify the need for illegal labor are so eerily similar to those that were used to justify our own peculiar institution 150   years ago .

teachers,"An unfortunate example of agenda setting by the Times. No one argues that less experience would be a plus for a lawyer, a physician, a nurse, a journalist, a policeman, an accountant, or, for that matter, a fry cook. Yet the private education industry's rationale for hiring and retention policies that are clearly driven by minimization of labor costs and maximization of profits is somehow worthy of serious consideration. Similarly, we are asked to believe that talent, expertise, and wisdom in the realm of education is offered by wealthy philanthropists, corporate executives, consultants, and government officials, but not by those who actually teach students. Unfortunately, there's just too much potential profit to made to allow public education in its present form to remain. Teachers will in fact eventually be replaced by semiskilled educational associates who will facilitate delivery of uniform content centrally developed by corporations. Platform standardization will allow content development to be offshored. With any luck, my kids will be finished with school before that day comes.","An unfortunate example of agenda setting by the Times .

tfa,"One of the most important contributions to US education from TFA alumni has not been mentioned by any of the contributors to this discussion. The TFA alumni who leave teaching for other careers retain their knowledge of the real conditions of poor children and their schools. They can and do give voice to those realities in political debates and can counter the many (often willfully) ignorant claims of opponents of public education. Just as Peace Corp volunteers are a source of reality about the Third World, so TFA alumni can and do continue to advocate for poor children and their schools when they become investment bankers, lawyers, or other high earners. Such advocacy doesn't direct benefit the children they taught, but it will benefit public education. TFA recognizes that we need to change the political debate over public education as much as we need to get top graduates into schools as teachers. Rather than harp on the limits of TFA, we should recognize that Wendy Kopp has found a way to move politics in a progressive direction and spend our efforts applying its lessons to other areas of public policy and politics.","One of the most important contributions to US education from TFA alumni has not been mentioned by any of the contributors to this discussion .
