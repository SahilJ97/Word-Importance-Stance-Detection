home schoolers,"I echo the sentiments of others in this thread. As a childless person, it infuriates me to read these arguments. The thought of families getting a $5,000 tax credit -- a payment of $5,000 -- because they don't take advantage of taxpayer-funded schools is outrageous. I pay thousands of dollars a month in taxes for schools that I will never directly take advantage of. Shouldn't I get a tax credit? This philosophy of not paying for public services you don't directly use is poisonous. If you have a huge yard with playground equipment, should you get a tax credit for not using public parks? If you buy books instead of checking them out the library, should you get a tax credit? If you don't have a car and don't use highways, should you get a tax credit? Aside from that, this author's notion that ignoring the Constitution is what got us $14 trillion into debt is ludicrous. A decade of irresponsible tax cuts, two multi-trillion dollar wars and the worst recession of our lifetime has much more to do with it.",0,"I echo the sentiments of others in this thread .

Perhaps we are being made less discerning through the ubiquitous barrage of marketing - a child of 3 would have been exposed to millions of TV ads - however that child will probably be more competent in the USE not necessarily the DEVELOPMENT of technology, than an adult of today. Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it.

veganism,"I haven't read through all the comments, but I strongly feel that diet (and what keeps one healthy) is extremely individual and dependent on many things-including allergies, sensitivities, previous medical history, religious experience, and emotional situations, to name a few. I grew up with a father who was a heavy smoker. Possibly as a result, I was given large doses of steroids (to which I became addicted) because I had asthma throughout much of my adolescence. I was also put on thyroid medication for seven years unnecessarily because, at that time, the measures for thyroid were faulty. So today I suffer from osteoporosis and so have adopted a diet rich in calcium. Fortunately, I am not too lactose intolerant and can handle milk products, unless I pick up a virus. I mention all of this to point out that we all have our individual food needs and shouldn't feel compelled to tell others what's good for them.",0,"I have n't read through all the comments , but I strongly feel that diet ( and what keeps one healthy ) is extremely individual and dependent on many things - including allergies , sensitivities , previous medical history , religious experience , and emotional situations , to name a few .

marijuana,"Wow, the war on drugs. People were smoking marijuana for ten thousand years before it was outlawed here in the 1930s. Why was it outlawed?

Hemp, or marijuana, so he funded and campaign for its end as a legal product in the US. We see how the drug war has ended. Your reasoning could be applied to breast milk, most people had some, and some of them became addicts.

fees,The way banks structure their fees for their services is absurd. The free account but profits made through hidden unrelated fees no one expects. It is like grocery stores that offered all their food for free to pull the most possible customers from competitors. But then they charge random cars in the parking lot $100 for parking more than 10 minutes. They charge a $10 surcharge on exit for every child that enters the store (with no signs posted about this on entrance). And an assortment of other fees that change as people catch on. And yet people keep coming for the free food. When the store wants to increase profits it comes up with more absurd fees.,0,The way banks structure their fees for their services is absurd .

When the land was divided between Arabs and Jews in 1948 it was an Arab army which swept into Israel, not an Israeli army which swept into the neighboring Arab countries. Arab Jews were expelled from Arab countries and Palestinians were expelled from Israel. For too long the Arabs have played an all or nothing game. The only peace they want is one with no Jewish State. Calling the entire area Palestine under Arab rule or using the euphemism of a non-denominational democratic Israel (in the Arab world of Islamic Republics?) the goal is the same: The eradication of the Jewish State. Palestinian leadership is so weak and so vulnerable to violent overthrow that they cannot make the tough choices of trading concessions with Israel. Only when there is strong leadership, one voice for the Palestinians, and widespread Palestinian support for trading concessions with Israel can there be peace.",1,"Perhaps when the Arabs are ready to recognize their own culpability for their situation and stop blaming Israel , the US and Santa Claus for all their problems we might get a resolution to the conflict .

public preschool,"There is a similar system in the UK. All children aged 3 and upwards are entitled to 15 hours of preschool / nursery per week. This ensures that children are well-socialized and exposed to group environments before they start school, which is at the age of 4 / turning 5 in the UK. Another option for the US would be to just lower the school starting age. In my state, California, the cut-off date for children starting kindergarten is September 1st. As my son's birthday is in October, this means he will be almost 6 years old before he is in any kind of group learning or social environment (unless we decide to put him preschool of course).

casinos,"it hilarious that the states scream for Casino's yet fear legalizing marijuana. Gambling destroys more families than marijuana ever did. Casino's prey far more on those who can least afford to gamble than it does in attracting the extremely wealthy to gamble away what they have in the same percentage terms. Know why ? Rich are rich for a reason, they did not gamble away their chance at success, wasting their money on a dream of striking it rich. Casino's pay terribly low wages for service persons. Casino's in the end cost society more than they can ever generate to the states or federal gov't. Casino's should as they always were be a destination resort to insure those that do gamble can at least afford it. I never saw a poor person at Atlantis in the Bahamas, or Aruba, I cannot say the same for Foxwoods, Atlantic City, or even Las Vegas. At one time Las Vegas was a destination resort, now it too exploits the poor more than taking from tourists I don't gamble, but I do enjoy watching people play, I don't enjoy watching them lose.",0,"it hilarious that the states scream for Casino 's yet fear legalizing marijuana .

opioid training,"The author assumes the conclusion about education on opioids- without providing evidence. Like Ioannidis said we have an epidemic of opinions in medicine today. Some studies have shown that education in opioids improves care. There is also studies showing education on pain care improves pain care. Education on opioids will miss the mark, in my opinion, if the goal is to improve pain care and prevent addiction to opioids. It is clear doctors do not wish to have education in either pain care or on opioids- as statements by the AMA and aafp and efforts by the MSSNY are indicative of. But being a doctor is not a god given right and society has the right to dictate to those who want to be doctors what education they need to obtain and maintain their license. So we should try to reeducate doctors in both using opioids and in pain care- its morally right and there is evidence that it can improve care.",1,"The author assumes the conclusion about education on opioids- without providing evidence .

prostituion,"How is prostitution different from gambling? Both are going to happen no matter what the law. Both are called vices. People moralize about both. Both can be risky and addictive.

There is a correlation between our high unemployment rate and outsourcing.

Because outsourcing has the mantra of cheapest and lowest cost, our neighbors and children pay the cost. The wages paid in India, China, Brazil are not enough to support American lifestyles, communities and housing.
