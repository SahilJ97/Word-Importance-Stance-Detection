Everyone loves the winning gambler but nobody loves the habitual gambler that is on a losing streak. And contrary to common belief, making more money gambling does not equate to making more jobs available in any country with the only exceptions being those places that do not insure safe working conditions nor living wages to their employees. When a huge bank falters it immediately shakes the economy world wide as all the investors world wide begin to lose their gambling balls. When a huge bank falls every bank is affected and more banks will begin to fail as a result. The end is finally a repressed economy that the diminishing middle and lower classes must rescue in order to prevent a depression.
