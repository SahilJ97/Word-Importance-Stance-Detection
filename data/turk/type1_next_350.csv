kids,"Conservatives make me laugh when they struggle to keep their kids from learning evolution. What they're going to end up doing is keeping their children from having careers in science. Since I'm a liberal, that doesn't sound too bad to me. It keeps the competition down. People who don't accept evolution don't belong in science anyways. The more you cut out of your child's curriculum, the bigger the educational and career advantages you're handing to those kids whose parents aren't as nearly controlling and obsessive and ideologically blinkered as you are. So there is a free market solution to this problem. Maybe the Cato Institute should study that angle before they issue their next statement on the topic.",1,"Conservatives make me laugh when they struggle to keep their kids from learning evolution .

big banks,"Swagel argues that because these banks haven't jeopardized the financial system recently, they no longer pose any such threat. That is illogical. It is a form of post hoc ergo propter hoc reasoning. That JPMorganChase took months to determine the real amount of the Whale's losses proves it didn't have a handle on its own trading book. So not only did JPM not control its own traders, it was in the dark about what they were doing. And this was AFTER Dodd-Frank took effect. A bank with lax internal controls cannot overcome the weakness simply be getting so big that it can afford the resulting losses. Unless one assumes otherwise, there is still the risk that as a bank with lax internal controls grows, it's problems and risk to the system will grow correspondingly.",0,"Swagel argues that because these banks have n't jeopardized the financial system recently , they no longer pose any such threat .

electric cars,"I drove the Leaf last week. It's a super little car that will be launch electric travel for the masses. For those who claim it will run up electric prices by burning more oil, they just don't realize that coal burning electric plants never shut down. One can't save electricity. You don't turn the plant off at night just because demand is low. That's why charging cars at night makes so much sense. Secondly, if you have solar in your home, you're already providing the grid with additional clean power. I hope that green technology will go hand-in-hand with the Leaf and other electric vehicles. And lastly, the average person drives less than one hundred miles a day. This giant fear of getting stuck is just that -- fear. It's amazing how fear stops progress. Be bold people.

research papers,"""Are research papers a waste of time?"" Absolutely not! The internet may give students and scholars easy access to sources, but many of these sources are flawed or unreliable in some way. Now more than ever, students need to know how to sift through information to find reliable sources and well-constructed arguments. Writing a research paper is still the best way to do this.

a tax break,"I disagree with the above comments and the article. First, the constitutional restraint argument is just ridiculous in the country we live in. Enumerated powers? We started trending away from that when the income tax was passed in what...1916 I think? If we actually practiced anything like constitutional restraint in other areas I would probably buy it but as things stand? No way. As to the childless not getting tax breaks for public schools they don't use because we are all contributing to the next generation... a good argument based on moral principles,but why get all holy all the sudden? The tax code is far from principled. We subsidize homeowners. I am not a homeowner. Not fair. And there is not even a moral argument for that massive tax break. Yet there it is. Why not give something new a chance? The only problem with homeschooling is that it is dominated by right-wing bible-thumpers.

sports program in undergraduate schools,"The problem is wound up in a simple fact: Division I and probably most of Div II and a lot of Division III institutions serve as (unpaid and unacknowledged) minor league franchises in football and basketball.

Athletes recruited (or volunteering) for either sport should not be expected to enroll for degrees or take classes. They may opt to do so, but must achieve and have access to certain kinds of academic support. Those athletes in either sport who opt not to enroll or who enroll but find they must drop out would be assured places as students for (pick a number of years), beyond the their collegiate playing days. Frankly, I'd prefer simply to force the NFL and the NBA to set up a separate minor league system, as MLB has for many decades. But, given alumni and other pressures, that is unlikely.

And spare us the argument that low taxes on capital gains promotes economic growth. Under low capital gains tax (since the 1980s) growth was slower than in the post-war periods, when taxes were high. And virtually all the benefits of growth have gone to the rich.",0,"I am surprised that the Times should give this crackpot idea so much space . Capital gains is the income of the rich .

people,An experience similar to Ms. Jackson's at CVS highlighted the degeneration of mathematical facility in young people. My bill at a fast food restaurant came to $10.15 and I handed the young lady behind the register $20.15. She looked at the 15 cents and at me all puzzled; she shuffled it around the counter. Then she entered $20.15 into the register and when it showed that the change due was $10.00 her face lit up. The mystery puzzle was solved. She looked at me with an awe that reflected her amazement that I could think of this ingenious gambit. Needless to say I was also amazed. I am similary awed when I read of surveys wherein significant numbers of college students (even in Southern California) could not identify a country that borders the U.S. or did not know which side the U.S. fought on in WWII.,0,An experience similar to Ms. Jackson 's at CVS highlighted the degeneration of mathematical facility in young people .

Assad uses horrible means to stay in power but we should not forget that before the trouble started he was quite popular and many assume that he might win free elections. Daily life in peace under ISIS is fundamentally more troublesome. The trouble with expanding attacks on ISIS to Syria is that it gives Washington a role in the Syrian conflict.

fees,"I'm beginning to see that up here in Soviet Kanukistan, we have it REALLY cushy when it comes to the banking industry. There is open, honest competition between banks for the customer's business, for one thing: not apparent collusion between major banks to charge similar fees and stifle true competition!! I pay $8.5 per month, get free debit services, free checking, 10 ATM transactions per month, and my overdraft fees are only $5 per shot (thank goodness, lol!!). Most ATMs charge $1.5 for transactions not associated with their sponsoring banks and even the private ones only ask this much. I remember visiting the USA in 1998 and simply refusing to pay $3 just to use an ATM!!!! The USA is the richest country on the planet, with the hugest bank profits... looks like exploiting the poor and vulnerable in their society is one of the ways they GOT so rich in the first place.",0,"I 'm beginning to see that up here in Soviet Kanukistan , we have it REALLY cushy when it comes to the banking industry .

a celebrity,"As another commentator mentioned, the widespread use of cell phone cameras and convenient connectivity of the Internet make it easy to catch and publicize celebrities living their lives. In the old days, photography required a large bulky camera, a big flash gun, and time to set up the camera. Today's cell phones take a reasonable-quality photo instantly. Actors and sports figures are not public policy makers. As opposed to public government officials (elected or appointed), celebrities do not decide how much taxes we pay, what laws we must observe, or whether we go to war. As such, they should be give more privacy. In other words, it may be in the public interest to publicize a congressman patronizing a brothel, especially when that congressman takes a high moralistic political position. When an actor or sports figure (or a retired out-of-office politician for that matter) does such a thing, it doesn't affect the rest of us and isn't really a matter of the public interest. Of course, some celebrities like the publicity and generate it themselves. They feel compelled to announce (and the media feels compelled to publish) when they start a new relationship or terminate one.",1,"As another commentator mentioned , the widespread use of cell phone cameras and convenient connectivity of the Internet make it easy to catch and publicize celebrities living their lives .

Enlisted men who had had be selected to learn surveying had mathematic skills that were so weak we did not try to teach lowest common denominator when we covered fractions. I don't think we are getting dumber and we still have a system that can discover talent in students from less privileged backgrounds. The present state of political discourse is discouraging, but in the past we have had Senator McCarthy and his list of communists in the State Department, the hysteria leading to the Spanish-American War, the American Civil War and a very long list of disturbing events in Europe from the Holocaust to the Crusades.
