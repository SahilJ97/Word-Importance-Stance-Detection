The biggest fear now is that when Tea Partiers and Republicans finish taking the government apart with the rataionale of getting spending under control, unemployment may be higher. Because outsourcing has the mantra of cheapest and lowest cost, our neighbors and children pay the cost.

Diesel cars are 50% of the cars on the road in Europe. They ARE available in the U.S. But the reason that the electric car is not likely to go anywhere in the next decade or two in this country will be the same reason that Americans do not have 50% of their cars using clean diesel. The SMART car has been in Canada for sometime, but in Canada it runs on a 3 cylinder diesel and gets over twice the mileage I get. But why isn't the diesel version of the Smart car in the U.S.? The clean diesel Smart cars of Canada and my VW Jetta both meet California emission standards. When the U.S. government can explain to the American public why we are so far behind Europe technologically, then perhaps we will move to fuel efficient vehicles. Electric cars in the U.S.A. will have the same fate as 8 track tapes and Sony Beta.
