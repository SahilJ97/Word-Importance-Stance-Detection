,,,a tax break,"Bruce S. Cooper's reasoning lacks supporting evidence: home-schooling parents do not save the taxpayers any money just as parents' whose ill children miss several days of public school do not save taxpayers money. Nor do parents who send their children to parochial schools save tax dollars. Public schools still have to be built, maintained and staffed regardless of whether some families keep its children at home or choose to send their children to private or parochial schools. Public education must plan and staff to educate _every_ child in the district. I have yet to see any empirical evidence to support the idea that home-schooling or private or religious schools save the taxpayers' money. Flinging around statistics about the average per pupil cost of public education is not the same thing as providing evidence that private or home education reduce the necessary expenditures of public school systems.

,,,your cat,I believe that declawing cats is animal abuse. Claws are a cats first line of defense and without their claws they are defenseless. I wish they would make this illegal everywhere. It is selfish for owners to do this. I have two cats who came to me already declawed and I worry that if I did not take them in they would be stray outside cats and probably would not survive. Also one of my cats loves sitting outside in the flower pot and would love to be outside more to explore and fully experience cat behaviors if she had her claws. It is also incredibly painful for the animal and even today just touching my declawed cats front paws makes her wince. If furniture is such a priority maybe you shouldn't have pets or keep them in a different area of your home. Declawing cats fingernails in my mind is equal to removing our feet and hands.

Assad uses horrible means to stay in power but we should not forget that before the trouble started he was quite popular and many assume that he might win free elections.

Rich are rich for a reason, they did not gamble away their chance at success, wasting their money on a dream of striking it rich. Casino's pay terribly low wages for service persons. Casino's in the end cost society more than they can ever generate to the states or federal gov't. Casino's should as they always were be a destination resort to insure those that do gamble can at least afford it. I never saw a poor person at Atlantis in the Bahamas, or Aruba, I cannot say the same for Foxwoods, Atlantic City, or even Las Vegas. At one time Las Vegas was a destination resort, now it too exploits the poor more than taking from tourists I don't gamble, but I do enjoy watching people play, I don't enjoy watching them lose.",0,"it hilarious that the states scream for Casino 's yet fear legalizing marijuana .

Some studies have shown that education in opioids improves care. There is also studies showing education on pain care improves pain care. Education on opioids will miss the mark, in my opinion, if the goal is to improve pain care and prevent addiction to opioids. It is clear doctors do not wish to have education in either pain care or on opioids- as statements by the AMA and aafp and efforts by the MSSNY are indicative of. But being a doctor is not a god given right and society has the right to dictate to those who want to be doctors what education they need to obtain and maintain their license. So we should try to reeducate doctors in both using opioids and in pain care- its morally right and there is evidence that it can improve care.",1,"The author assumes the conclusion about education on opioids- without providing evidence .
