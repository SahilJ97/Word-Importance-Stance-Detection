rim,"Red Aurebach was asked about raising the rim to neutralize some of the putative advantage held by taller players. He said, I think correctly, that raising the rim would increase that advantage, not decrease it. Are you advocating raising the rim only in the NBA? Should Division I programs also follow suit. Surely high school players would not want the rim raised, many of them short and land locked. And how many players in the NBA cannot dunk? Nobody would be my guess. You want to neutralize the advantage of taller player? Box out. You want to bring back the mid range jumper? Get rid of the 3 point shot. I disagree with you Mr. Monroe, but I loved that spin move (even though I think you traveled a lot of the time cupping the ball).",0,"Red Aurebach was asked about raising the rim to neutralize some of the putative advantage held by taller players .

a gateway drug,"Two of the main reasons people switch to cannabis from pharmaceuticals and other drugs such as alcohol: less side-effects and less withdrawal: ""Over 41% state that they use cannabis as a substitute for alcohol, 36.1% use cannabis as a substitute for illicit substances, and 67.8% use cannabis as a substitute for prescription drugs.

a gateway drug,"At 70 I can smoke pot using a vaporizer for joint pain, and feel good or not. There is no tolerance. There is no withdrawal.

Some of the smartest students I've met at Utah State University found that out-of-state tuition at USU is tens of thousands of dollars less than in-state tuition in California.

Industrial research and development has driven a new world of technology which enables many more people to use innovative electronic appliances designed by the few. 50 years ago if your car stalled you would more than likely know why and if you towed it home, perhaps fix it.

Also, I usually refer to knowledgeable (and kind) psychiatrist, not general practitions who may not know these drugs very well.

It does what it wants, secure in the belief that it has one party (the Democrats) hobbled and muffled and the other (guess which) in its back pocket, where AIPAC's money is.

FOr instance, the NOrthern California coast is spectacular, north of San Francisco. I find it offensive to come to a place like Sea Ranch, and find that all the pullouts along highway 1 in this area, from where one can walk to the beach, require you to pay a fee to park. So, unless you are traveling the highway without a car, there is no way to access the beach at Sea Ranch without paying a fee. THis should be forbidden.

overcrowding,"Well in the last 50 years there has been at least a small improvement in thinking. One doesn't hear ""god will take care of us"" or ""we have always found new sources of oil before"" as much as one used to. But there is still a very limited understanding of the problem, probably because so few of us thought seriously for a minute when our high school teachers were covering entropy and the second law of thermodynamics. The solar constant ultimately determines the carrying capacity since it provides us with all renewable energy sources: wind, water, solar. It must cover not only our daily energy needs, but also the energy needed to recover and reuse all non-renewable resources that we mine and scatter around the world as products. This limiting factor also means of course that all national states will approach zero-growth, steady state economies.",0,"Well in the last 50 years there has been at least a small improvement in thinking .

the u.s.,Claiming that Assad and ISIS are both evil suggest a moral equivalence that is unjustified. Assad uses horrible means to stay in power but we should not forget that before the trouble started he was quite popular and many assume that he might win free elections. Daily life in peace under ISIS is fundamentally more troublesome. The trouble with expanding attacks on ISIS to Syria is that it gives Washington a role in the Syrian conflict. We may also see that once Washington starts bombing them many ISIS members will start to call themselves members of Al Nusra or some other Syrian rebel group. In my opinion the only way to go forward is to strive for an agreement between Assad and the moderate opposition. Until now the US has sabotaged such negotiations and supported those rebels who don't want to compromise. But if Washington gets serious about negotiations and presses the other countries supporting the rebels to get similarly serious some compromise should be possible.,0,Claiming that Assad and ISIS are both evil suggest a moral equivalence that is unjustified .

We may also see that once Washington starts bombing them many ISIS members will start to call themselves members of Al Nusra or some other Syrian rebel group . In my opinion the only way to go forward is to strive for an agreement between Assad and the moderate opposition . Until now the US has sabotaged such negotiations and supported those rebels who do n't want to compromise . But if Washington gets serious about negotiations and presses the other countries supporting the rebels to get similarly serious some compromise should be possible .
a bad deal for cities and states,"In my state, the guards at the gates of a major Air Force base were privatized! A security company took over, despite thousands of soldiers on base. At least until the man who owned the security guard company took off one day without paying the guards. And that's just one case. In nearly every instance where knee-jerk privatizers take over, the workers lose pay and benefits, a few owners rake in our tax money, and services sink to the bottom of a deep, dark pit. In Afghanistan and Iraq, Halliburton et al. rake in billions year after year, take the lion's share, and then farm out the work to sub-sub-sub contractors, who get pennies on the dollar and do a cheap, ineffective job--if it's done at all. And no one in power complains. When do we stop the madness?",0,"In my state , the guards at the gates of a major Air Force base were privatized !

We know at least a dozen other vegan children who are healthy and high-functioning. That's consistent with the findings of the American Dietetic Association, the nation's largest organization of nutrition scientists, which has issued a position paper written by experts who reviewed the existing peer-reviewed literature and found that well-planned vegan diets are healthful for infants and children.

people,"I have taught at elite universities for the past 43 years. Before that, I served three years as an enlisted man in the United States Army and taught arithmetic to students in surveying students at the engineer school at Ft. Belvior. From this limited experience, I can make two observations. Students at elite universities have grown stronger in the last four decades and the state of American secondary education in 1964 was awful. Enlisted men who had had be selected to learn surveying had mathematic skills that were so weak we did not try to teach lowest common denominator when we covered fractions. I don't think we are getting dumber and we still have a system that can discover talent in students from less privileged backgrounds. The present state of political discourse is discouraging, but in the past we have had Senator McCarthy and his list of communists in the State Department, the hysteria leading to the Spanish-American War, the American Civil War and a very long list of disturbing events in Europe from the Holocaust to the Crusades.

The issues are whether California and the U.S. controls the borders and whether it enforces it's laws about immigrant and working in the state remain in no way resolved. Children who identify as Americans but who never were naturalized live in a strange condition which leaves them less than fully enfranchised and legally subject to deportation and unable to act as any another American is entitled.

The issues are whether California and the U.S. controls the borders and whether it enforces it 's laws about immigrant and working in the state remain in no way resolved . Children who identify as Americans but who never were naturalized live in a strange condition which leaves them less than fully enfranchised and legally subject to deportation and unable to act as any another American is entitled . Workers who are being exploited can do little about it unless they can force the employers on their own . We in California have not found an acceptable solution that can be relied upon indefinitely .

But in a large group it can become distracting and unproductive. Having worked in a few offices with open spaces, I found that employees chose privacy over open 9 times out of ten. Mr. Saval is 100% correct, workers understand their needs much better than executives. It would be a good idea to ask the employees before imposing an open space concept.

This idea of sharing ideas and information is mostly a myth . In a small group of people that know each other and have built trust it is invaluable . But in a large group it can become distracting and unproductive . Having worked in a few offices with open spaces , I found that employees chose privacy over open 9 times out of ten . Mr. Saval is 100 % correct , workers understand their needs much better than executives . It would be a good idea to ask the employees before imposing an open space concept . There 's nothing knew about the idea of having an open space work arrangement . I think they used to call it a secretarial pool back in the day ."

This is why the rich periodically call for amnesty (money not immigration) to bring their foreign wealth home to the US. That is because it is safer here.

the status of teachers,"The idea behind TFA is that simply a high GPA from a prestigious university will make one a great teacher. Anybody can do the job. Ha! Within two to three years, the majority of TFA are looking for any way to get out of the classroom. Some of the more notable failures, such as DC's Michele Rhee, then can parley their brief unsuccessful experiences into becoming superintendants of major school districts. This is called school reform.",0,"The idea behind TFA is that simply a high GPA from a prestigious university will make one a great teacher . Anybody can do the job . Ha !

electric cars,"There isn't enough Lithium, nickel and other minerals to manufacture the volume of batteries they are talking about. Any day now they'll be a lithium cartel forming in the image of OPEC and we'll be in the same bad situation. Hydrogen is the best solution. Talk about the lack of infrastructure for Hydrogen is just defeatist nonsense designed to maintain the status quo for the good of those who profit from it. Nobody used the lack of public charging stations or the lack of infrastructure for disposing/recycling used batteries as an excuse to stop the Batteries. In a decade we transformed the landscape with cell towers and converted our society to a mobile one and we can do the same with Hydrogen.",1,"There is n't enough Lithium , nickel and other minerals to manufacture the volume of batteries they are talking about .

people,"There is far too much intellectual relativism being discussed in this thread. What was once considered to be valuable to intelligence is not exactly the same now. We need to get over this idea of ""well, my kids do not even know all the state capitals!"" Of course they don't. There is no need to know something off the top of your head in an age when you can look it up instantly. The information that is ""vital"" to a person's intelligence is directly related to what they need to know to function well in their field. I teach English, I know nothing about welding. A welder may know very little about literature. Is one of us smarter than the other?",1,"There is far too much intellectual relativism being discussed in this thread .

syria,"Of course the YPG have been coordinating with the Russians, so has the United States! Moderate rebels? Seriously? Just because the Rebels opposing the Syrian Democratic Forces are backed by Turkey does that make them moderate? The Kurdish led coalition with Arabs and Syriac-Assyrians want to create a secular democracy within the borders of an autonomous region in a land otherwise ruled by terror. Is that such a bad thing? The whole point of war is to seize territory from those that are trying to kill you. Always has been all ways will. Two years ago the Kurds were almost pushed outside the borders of Syria and faced genocide, they will not let that happen again. I see you are a writer for Ak am Dail which is a Turk Government publication. I was going to take this piece seriously but I think your credentials speak for themselves.",1,"Of course the YPG have been coordinating with the Russians , so has the United States !

home schoolers,Let me understand this. Now that my kids are out of the public school system I should not have to pay the 80% of my property tax that goes to support my local schools? Or do I get a credit for supporting services that I do not use? Has this been thought out sufficiently? It seems that there is an equal protection problem here.,0,Let me understand this .
