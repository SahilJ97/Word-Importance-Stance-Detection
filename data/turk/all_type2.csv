rim,"Red Aurebach was asked about raising the rim to neutralize some of the putative advantage held by taller players. He said, I think correctly, that raising the rim would increase that advantage, not decrease it. Are you advocating raising the rim only in the NBA? Should Division I programs also follow suit. Surely high school players would not want the rim raised, many of them short and land locked. And how many players in the NBA cannot dunk? Nobody would be my guess. You want to neutralize the advantage of taller player? Box out. You want to bring back the mid range jumper? Get rid of the 3 point shot. I disagree with you Mr. Monroe, but I loved that spin move (even though I think you traveled a lot of the time cupping the ball).","Red Aurebach was asked about raising the rim to neutralize some of the putative advantage held by taller players .

your cat,"Good idea. I have always had a cat or two. While being inhumane, declawing places a cat in danger.

Would a spill in the Atlantic 50 miles out disperse away from the coast more than would a spill in the Arctic or the Gulf ? Because there surely will be one no matter how much the "" our drilling rigs , pipelines and trains are safe "" oil executives say .",1

To everyone outside the borders of Israel and the US it's beyond argument that this country is not an honest broker. Look at the situation in Washington.

There was a time not long ago that Israel at least had to dissemble about its intentions while it went about changing the facts on the ground. No longer. It does what it wants, secure in the belief that it has one party (the Democrats) hobbled and muffled and the other (guess which) in its back pocket, where AIPAC's money is. And of course anyone who dares point this out is called an anti-Semite. The sad thing is this state of affairs does not serve Israel's long-term interests.

Not only does it lead to demotivation in some, it now appears that it can permanenty lower the IQ of a teenage user by some 9 points. But alcohol also damages the teenage brain. What we need here is education, not prohibition, and a ban on advertising and promotion -- something we should have for alcohol and tobacco as well, but do not.","Kids already can and do use marijuana . The law is n't going to make a major difference here . It is hard to argue that marijuana should be illegal when alcohol and tobacco , both more harmful substances , are legal and widely promoted .

their land,"I would go even further. Making all beaches public, and requiring public access to all beaches WITHOUT the beach-goer having to pay a fee to get to the beach. FOr instance, the NOrthern California coast is spectacular, north of San Francisco. I find it offensive to come to a place like Sea Ranch, and find that all the pullouts along highway 1 in this area, from where one can walk to the beach, require you to pay a fee to park. So, unless you are traveling the highway without a car, there is no way to access the beach at Sea Ranch without paying a fee. THis should be forbidden. In my view, we should also prevent people from being able to buy land within a certain distance of the water in areas that remain undeveloped, in order to better preserve these undeveloped areas.","I would go even further .

overcrowding,"Well in the last 50 years there has been at least a small improvement in thinking. One doesn't hear ""god will take care of us"" or ""we have always found new sources of oil before"" as much as one used to. But there is still a very limited understanding of the problem, probably because so few of us thought seriously for a minute when our high school teachers were covering entropy and the second law of thermodynamics. The solar constant ultimately determines the carrying capacity since it provides us with all renewable energy sources: wind, water, solar. It must cover not only our daily energy needs, but also the energy needed to recover and reuse all non-renewable resources that we mine and scatter around the world as products. This limiting factor also means of course that all national states will approach zero-growth, steady state economies.","Well in the last 50 years there has been at least a small improvement in thinking .

the u.s.,Claiming that Assad and ISIS are both evil suggest a moral equivalence that is unjustified. Assad uses horrible means to stay in power but we should not forget that before the trouble started he was quite popular and many assume that he might win free elections. Daily life in peace under ISIS is fundamentally more troublesome. The trouble with expanding attacks on ISIS to Syria is that it gives Washington a role in the Syrian conflict. We may also see that once Washington starts bombing them many ISIS members will start to call themselves members of Al Nusra or some other Syrian rebel group. In my opinion the only way to go forward is to strive for an agreement between Assad and the moderate opposition. Until now the US has sabotaged such negotiations and supported those rebels who don't want to compromise. But if Washington gets serious about negotiations and presses the other countries supporting the rebels to get similarly serious some compromise should be possible.,Claiming that Assad and ISIS are both evil suggest a moral equivalence that is unjustified . Assad uses horrible means to stay in power but we should not forget that before the trouble started he was quite popular and many assume that he might win free elections . Daily life in peace under ISIS is fundamentally more troublesome . The trouble with expanding attacks on ISIS to Syria is that it gives Washington a role in the Syrian conflict . We may also see that once Washington starts bombing them many ISIS members will start to call themselves members of Al Nusra or some other Syrian rebel group . In my opinion the only way to go forward is to strive for an agreement between Assad and the moderate opposition . Until now the US has sabotaged such negotiations and supported those rebels who do n't want to compromise . But if Washington gets serious about negotiations and presses the other countries supporting the rebels to get similarly serious some compromise should be possible .,0
a bad deal for cities and states,"In my state, the guards at the gates of a major Air Force base were privatized! A security company took over, despite thousands of soldiers on base. At least until the man who owned the security guard company took off one day without paying the guards. And that's just one case. In nearly every instance where knee-jerk privatizers take over, the workers lose pay and benefits, a few owners rake in our tax money, and services sink to the bottom of a deep, dark pit. In Afghanistan and Iraq, Halliburton et al. rake in billions year after year, take the lion's share, and then farm out the work to sub-sub-sub contractors, who get pennies on the dollar and do a cheap, ineffective job--if it's done at all. And no one in power complains. When do we stop the madness?","In my state , the guards at the gates of a major Air Force base were privatized !

immigration,The employers who hire undocumented workers place a burden upon the society to either condone what they are doing or to act against it. Not doing anything about it results in worse living conditions for all as people who live without the rights and legal protections increase the misery for everyone. California's solution has been to try to be inclusive so that undocumented immigrants function in society mostly like everyone else without formally accepting the undocumented as legal residents but it's sidestepping the issue. The issues are whether California and the U.S. controls the borders and whether it enforces it's laws about immigrant and working in the state remain in no way resolved. Children who identify as Americans but who never were naturalized live in a strange condition which leaves them less than fully enfranchised and legally subject to deportation and unable to act as any another American is entitled. Workers who are being exploited can do little about it unless they can force the employers on their own. We in California have not found an acceptable solution that can be relied upon indefinitely.,The employers who hire undocumented workers place a burden upon the society to either condone what they are doing or to act against it . Not doing anything about it results in worse living conditions for all as people who live without the rights and legal protections increase the misery for everyone . California 's solution has been to try to be inclusive so that undocumented immigrants function in society mostly like everyone else without formally accepting the undocumented as legal residents but it 's sidestepping the issue . The issues are whether California and the U.S. controls the borders and whether it enforces it 's laws about immigrant and working in the state remain in no way resolved .

capital gains,There are a lot of reasons that revenue stays in the US regardless of the tax rate on capital gains. The stability of the government and protections from governmental nationalization are one large reason.

This is why the rich periodically call for amnesty (money not immigration) to bring their foreign wealth home to the US. That is because it is safer here. The rich's desire to return to feudalism where the poor carry the full burden of Government expense. Why is interest and dividend income less taxable than a workers paycheck?

a bad deal for cities and states,"If the function is a basic governmental function, the job surely can be done most economically with direct government supervision of the employees doing the job. With privatization there is profit and the overhead of having goverment agents doing the contracting and overseeing the contract. When the Ohio governor wants to sell publicly-owned prisons to private contractors and says that then they become profitable, it says to me that the governor's thinking is not working well. Who pays the bill to the private contractor? -- the government! Plus some profit, and the overhead of competing the contract and overseeing that the contract is being properly carried out!! Also, contracting out jobs opens the door for politicians giving the contracts to favorites. Civil service regulations prohibits some corruption with direct government employees.","If the function is a basic governmental function , the job surely can be done most economically with direct government supervision of the employees doing the job .

Here are a couple facts to balance out these doctors inaccurate and out of date views : From the CDC : Number of vaginal deliveries : 2,642,892 Number of Cesarean deliveries : 1,284,339 Percent of all deliveries by Cesarean : 32.7 % From Wikipedia : In those who are low risk the risk of death for Caesarian sections is 13 per 100,000 and for vaginal birth 3.5 per 100,000 in the developed world . The UK National Health Service gives the risk of death for the mother as three times that of a vaginal birth",1

Students must learn how to sort good sources from poor sources. They must learn to look at a writers or organizations credentials and decide if it is a qualified source.

A sad, limp remnant of a bygone era? Modern descendants of thugs who engaged in slaughter, rape and pillage before anointing themselves 'kings' deserve no respect or adulation from modern day citizens of the U.K. Even if modern royalty is only nominal and symbolic, their very existence is quite harmful to the notion of an egalitarian, democratic society to which all civilized people aspire. Put them (members of the so-called 'royal' household) out to pasture. Kings and queens belong in story books, and history books. As individuals, they're probably nice people, but the institution of monarchy is quite a different matter.","Does a country that produced Sir Isaac Newton , Michael Faraday , and Charles Darwin - to name a few - does the U.K. not have enough courage to recognize the monarchy for what it is ?

kids,"I have two extremely gifted children with ADHD. Their bodies are constantly in motion, and when they were younger, they could be up and wandering the classroom without even being aware of it. They would blurt out answers, talk with their peers, and fidget ceaselessly. Part of it was boredom, yes, but with medication, they were able to learn how to monitor their behavior, to slow down their bodies, and to interact appropriately with their classmates. The teacher was able to provide enrichment lessons instead of focusing on their disruptive behavior. We parents were able to teach them self-control techniques. As they aged, we were able to wean them off meds, and they function just fine in high school. Unmedicated, I doubt they would have received the appropriately differentiated education that has allowed them to succeed in school. If a child truly has ADHD, then denying them medication is the equivalent of denying a near-sighted child glasses.","I have two extremely gifted children with ADHD .

vaccination,"It seems clear from reading the comments that the vaccine debate is falsely represented. While there are those who absolutely refuse any vaccinations, they are clearly in the minority. In fact, the vast majority of those who question the childhood vaccine schedule are looking most closely at a few of them, specifically Varicella, Flu, Hepatitis B and to some extent MMR. Their reasons for questioning these vaccines are solid and sound, and answers are still lacking to key questions about their safety, effectiveness and necessity. There is another camp of people who, like me, believe in vaccines and vaccinate their children but who question the recommendations and educate myself. I am lucky to have a child who can handle vaccinations without consequence, but it is cruel and disrespectful to families affected by vaccine injuries to claim that their child's suffering is for the greater good. You don't need a medical degree to think critically about your family's health and to demand answers from vaccine manufacturers who are, frankly, not forthcoming with information.","It seems clear from reading the comments that the vaccine debate is falsely represented .

Remember this, Jordan, Egypt, Syria and Lebanon attacked Israel in 1948. Their collective goal was to wipe out the nascent Jewish State and murder all the Jews living there. But, they lost and Israel grew by a few kilometers. Jordan ended up on the West bank, occupying East Jerusalem, while Egypt occupied the Gaza Strip.

And no , we do n't look like grizzlies , but we do look a hell of a lot like chimps and other primates that will rip animals apart with their bare hands and "" digest the raw innards "" just fine . Please do n't base your argument on "" the logic of the animal kingdom "" when you clearly have no concept of biology or evolution . You 're a chef , so you presumably know a lot about food . Why not construct an argument around the food itself instead of a subject you do n't seem to know anything about ? Just a suggestion . Thanks . Hugs and kisses . P.S. How did this actually make it into print ? NYT editors , I expected better .",1

their land,"I am not now, nor Have I ever been a beach person. I have often commented that beach front property would be wasted on me, and those who most want it and are willing to pay for it should have it. I do, however, believe that private ownership should be limited to the spaces above and adjoining the beaches. Public access to the beach seems to be a no-brainer. I believe we should also make these private owners of beach adjacent property responsible for rebuilding their own homes when the next storm or tsunami comes their way. Beach cottages used to be ramshackle affairs, built on sticks, with second hand wicker furniture. Now the hoipolloi builds mega million dollar mansions, filled with great furniture and art on the beach. Surprise surprise, your house got washed a way again. The Federal Government should stop encouraging and supplementing people who build irresponsible sand castles on foundations of sand.","I am not now , nor Have I ever been a beach person .

everyone,"I admire vegans because they've chosen a challenging lifestyle requiring a lot of work, discipline and attention. I tried it briefly because I'm so repulsed by the idea of eating a dead animal. It's so primitive. But after a few weeks of veganism I craved dairy foods so much that I couldn't think straight. So I gave in, and drink milk and eat cheese and eggs. And when I have an overwhelming desire for some meat I eat just a very small amount. Judging from my experience, I'm left with the feeling that humans should perhaps evolve biologically, slowly, and wean themselves from meat over many years. Accent plant foods and cut meat servings to half, for starters. I do believe there will come a time, perhaps 100 years from now, when humans will look back on meat eating with disgust.","I admire vegans because they 've chosen a challenging lifestyle requiring a lot of work , discipline and attention .

pot,"I'd like to know where Dr. Evins is getting her statistics. They contradict virtually everything I've read about marijuana, and they contradict my personal experience. I smoked marijuana from August 1972 to November 1973, at first fairly rarely, eventually nearly daily, for a few weeks twice daily, then abruptly stopped completely for about two months, then smoked a few times a week for a couple months. I haven't smoked in since. These changes in usage had to do with availability and (mostly) social circumstances. (I didn't begin to crave it more; I gradually lost interest as the novelty wore off.) Marijuana in those days was very much a social drug; I smoked it alone just once in my life. I wouldn't even say that stopping and starting was easy; it was nothing whatsoever. I never encountered anyone at any time in my life who showed the slightest sign of being even slightly addicted. (I do know what addiction is. I've known many people, some of them close to me, clearly addicted to alcohol.) It's true, however, that marijuana does cause ""like memory and cognitive impairment""--TEMPORARILY.

I have n't smoked in since . These changes in usage had to do with availability and ( mostly ) social circumstances . ( I did n't begin to crave it more ; I gradually lost interest as the novelty wore off . ) Marijuana in those days was very much a social drug ; I smoked it alone just once in my life . I would n't even say that stopping and starting was easy ; it was nothing whatsoever . I never encountered anyone at any time in my life who showed the slightest sign of being even slightly addicted . ( I do know what addiction is . I 've known many people , some of them close to me , clearly addicted to alcohol . ) It 's true , however , that marijuana does cause "" like memory and cognitive impairment""--TEMPORARILY . It 's called "" being stoned "" .",1
income,"""Yes, let's make college admissions (and even private K- 12 school please) based more on socioeconomics than race."" Let's be honest, people who argue this have little or no interest increasing the number of black college students and graduates. They are quite comfortable with reduced enrollment that the University of Michigan has seen since the law banning race and gender based AA was imposed by Michigan voters. Rather, what drives the opposition to affirmative action is the notion that ONLY blacks (and some Hispanics) are getting more than their so-called fair share. What these folks conveniently ignore is that we have affirmative action for white people as well, in the form of legacy preferences. Michigan voters didn't include those in the ban, because of course it favors the children of college graduates who as a group are disproportionately white. My point is there's a great deal of hypocrisy in the 'class not race' argument. Opposition to affirmative action seems not to depend on what we think is the best way to alleviate the under-representation of non-white students at our universities, but on what race or gender you belong to.",""" Yes , let 's make college admissions ( and even private K- 12 school please ) based more on socioeconomics than race .

The countries in Eastern Europe with no Muslim populations have zero terrorism and zero ethnic and cultural problems. So lets not play the ostrich's part here and hide our heads in the sand. The idea that all Syria should move to Europe is naive and preposterous. If we talked about dozens of political refugees, that would work, but right now we are talking about a million Islamic colonists who are forcing the hand of a weak PC Europe and US. The UN should build new and bigger refugees camps around Syria, and Europe should put all of them in planes and send them there. More than half would go back home, only the real refugees will stay in the camps.","The NYT must have looked long and hard to find someone in Europe to argue their own position on this issue , ( the fifth out of five with no one having a different opinion ) because most Europeans are not on the same page as Mr. Grand .

income,"I would support the idea of class-based vs. race-based admission affirmative action in college admissions. If it is true that race is a large factor in economic disadvantage and denied opportunities, then class based AA will address that. Otherwise, it creates more discrimination based on race, and assumptions (fair or not) that a student got in only because of race. While Texas does many things wrong, their 10% rule for the top two universities generally addresses this. It is very transparent, and everyone knows the expectation going in. The AA idea based on race is in itself racist, since it assumes that race alone is a factor in ability and achievement. As an example, if my child was 1/16 Chickasaw instead of 1/32 Chickasaw, he could have received a full ride. It has nothing to do with character, academic ability, or income. The whole thing is a big game designed to make the universities look good on paper to meet whatever goals they need to get funding. I don't see it helping the students and parents who are struggling to get in and pay the tuition to stay in.","I would support the idea of class - based vs. race - based admission affirmative action in college admissions .

a way for people to get into popular restaurants,"I don't comprehend the anger and vitriol. It comes across as a very conservative sense of entitlement. A restaurant is paying for food, drinks, service, ambience, seating, location, and a million other things. Some of these items are separately charged for, such as the food and drinks one orders, while others are recouped by unallocated charges on your bill. Part of that steak or wine you bought is actually going to dishwashing, real estate taxes, and new linens. Why should we get upset that some people are being specially charged for what they receive? It seems as silly to me as being angry that somebody who ordered lobster and whiskey pays more than somebody who got a sandwich and water. Should all diners be charged the same flat fee, regardless of their food consumption? If not, then I don't see why diners should be charged the same flat fee, regardless of their demand for prime reservations.","I do n't comprehend the anger and vitriol .

our dreams,"I've had nightmares since early childhood, as early as I can remember. Also suffered from some degree of depression most of my life. Ten or fifteen years ago I discovered I could, sometimes, change the course of the dream from terrible to ok; stopping the terror I was feeling in the dream. I have to feel that if one can end or control a nightmare, one should; the constant nightly terrors disturbed my sleep terribly, and I never felt rested in the daytime. When I can change a dream, I rest much better. Oh, and while I was taking a certain antidepressant which I got off this year, all memory of dreams pretty much stopped. When I began to wean off it, the nightmares returned, but went away in a short time. In much of my adult life I have felt helpless to control what happened to me, but I believe that when I learned to control the nighmares' outcomes, I began to feel more control in waking life, too.","I 've had nightmares since early childhood , as early as I can remember .

sports program in undergraduate schools,"Throughout my school years--from elementary school on--I was completely incompetent in every kind of physical activity that I tried. As a result, in the competitive environment that prevailed in the 1950s and 1960s (and, I suspect, continues to the present), I was not just sidelined but humiliated, and not just by my fellow students, but by adult coaches, too.

dual citizenship,"Historically, the kind of sentimental nationalism expressed by Mr. Krikorian is a relatively recent phenomenon, and in its more potent forms -- as, for example, considering citizenship as intense as marriage, 'till death do us part' -- has often been a source of dangerous emotional politics and policy-making. Citizenship takes the universal human sense of membership in a community, and association with persons one sees every day and interacts with in many ways, and extends it in the imagination to a much larger circle, the nation. Such 'imagined community' is valuable in spurring solidarity and shared commitments beyond the local, but it is also vulnerable to emotional intensification and mythomania. The historical record of peoples subject to intense nationalist feelings -- many European nations in the 19th and early 20th century, more recently Serbia and now, more and more, China -- has been one of war-making, aggression, and disdain for others. Nationalism, and the intense 'marriage-like' sense of citizenship that it engenders, is a double-edged sword: valuable in moderation, dangerous when exaggerated, as Mr. Krikorian does.","Historically , the kind of sentimental nationalism expressed by Mr. Krikorian is a relatively recent phenomenon , and in its more potent forms -- as , for example , considering citizenship as intense as marriage , ' till death do us part ' -- has often been a source of dangerous emotional politics and policy - making .

helping condo developers,"This article is not only misleading but really a flat out lie. Most condominium owners in NYC are not foreign billionaires, but average families trying to make a living like everyone else. Further more, condo owners pay a much higher tax than home owner do on similarly priced homes. This is because in NYC houses are assessed an the basis of their market value. Condos are assessed on their market values as commercial (ie. rental properties), which allows the city to arbitrarily assign a much higher value to condos, and therefore a much higher tax. For instance, right now, one can find a $550K house in St. Albans with taxes of $4972. per year and a $529k condo in Battery park city with annual taxes of $9000. This is despite the fact, that most multi unit condos use less city services, less space and less energy than a similar number of houses. Even if condo owners and developers get a tax abatement during the initial years, these expire and they end up paying substantially higher taxes overall. The system is patently unfair to condo owners, and this article is simply dishonest!","This article is not only misleading but really a flat out lie .

in-state students,"I was a teaching assistant while in grad school at the University of California nearly 30 years ago and was amazed how many foreign students were in my classes. Some of them had no idea - or desire - how to do the work & whined & confronted me when they got their less than stellar grades. Rich, entitled jerks. Two very wealthy spoiled guys from Saudi Arabia (who hated being taught by a woman) were openly contemptuous of me and one tried to get me fired because I gave him a C. (which was generous of me). I used to wonder why UC was filling so many spaces with these people when it seemed nearly every 18 year old in the state of California was trying to get admitted to UC. I imagine most of them were more deserving than the spoiled foreign students I met. One exception: the students from Iran. I probably taught several dozen of them. Really smart & hardworking. Good attitudes. Thought that was worth saying.","I was a teaching assistant while in grad school at the University of California nearly 30 years ago and was amazed how many foreign students were in my classes .

public universities,"The UC system was envisioned in the 1960's to admit 13% of California high school students. Today, in practice, approximately 9% are admitted. Some of the reduction in admittance rates results from the fact that a larger number of students from out of state are admitted in order to capture more revenue. Regardless of this student's grades or scores, the fact is that a very large number of highly qualified students are turned away from the UC system every year. The impact is serious--they attend lesser in-state schools, go to out-of-state public universities, or they attend private schools. The other in-state schools are less expensive, but do not provide the same quality of education. Out-of-state public universities and private schools cost much more money, making these options harder for students to pursue. This doesn't seem like a wise education policy. The State of California ends up with a large number of students who are less educated, have higher debt rates, or leave the state permanently.","The UC system was envisioned in the 1960 's to admit 13 % of California high school students .

companies,"Every thing found in nature got to be by some kind of mutation and even engineered genes are now found in nature. The difference would not be detectable unless one has prior knowledge of some kind. So engineering is a cause of mutation as well as human intervention. The purpose of patents is to provide a monopoly in the market for the innovators in order to encourage innovations. But extended monopolies tend to discourage further innovations, so the length of patents must be limited. The patenting of naturally occurring gene sequences has resulted in the legal requirement of anyone treating conditions related to those sequences patented be approved by and compensation provided to the patent holders. It's a perverse use of patents that actually inhibits innovations and blocks medical care for seriously ill patients. It's morally and ethically degenerate and it violates the principle that knowledge about nature is not subject to patents or copyrights.

women,"Sounds like what Stephanie Coontz calls ""two birds in a nest"" raising a family - parents and children in one household, no one else around the ideal for the 1950's - is just not a good idea for those who do not have a trust fund.

nonprofit status,"No one should be tax exempt. Enough of this never ending debate about who gets favored and who does not. If we are going to tax income in America, we should stop playing favorites and tax every dollar of income exactly the same. Whether earned by KBronson, the NYT, the Catholic Church, the Girl Scouts, or Exxon, we should tax every dollar at the same rate--no matter who earned it or what they spend it on. A simple direct tax policy like that would send this country on a growth spurt that it hasn't seen since the 1950's, and get the government out of our personal decisions.","No one should be tax exempt .

women,"I would have liked to end my second, low-risk pregnancy with a home birth at our home a mile from two hospitals with full maternity wards and neonatal intensive care. This turned out not to be possible because none of the certified nurse midwives in town were willing to attend a home birth, and I wanted a midwife with at least that level of training. Instead, I went to the hospital, where my husband functioned very effectively as my midwife for 4 of my 5 hours of labor. The midwife appeared within an hour of the birth and was busy gathering supplies when the baby was born, so I caught him myself. After filling out paperwork, the midwife left and I literally never heard from her again. No MD was ever involved. For this birth, the charge was over $3,000.

pot,"Legalization is just too dangerous, says Ms. Evins. Has she studied the Rat Park experiments? Conducted over 20 years in a prestigious lab, then published as peer-reviewed journal studies, they establish that addiction is almost impossible to induce when the subjects are living in healthy environments. Oh, one detail: the subjects were rats...which correlate to humans 80% of the time in lab study results. So there's an 80% chance that human addiction results not from the substance but from deprived, abusive environments. There is a place she could put her efforts productively, instead of fighting a losing battle against a public jaded by decades of lies.","Legalization is just too dangerous , says Ms. Evins .

national security,"As the son of a farmer, I reluctantly agree with the author's conclusion. Farm subsidies grossly reward a small-percentage of large-scale corporate farms and businesses, which now operate on scales in vast disproportion to the revered Jeffersonian single-farmer business. Farm subsidies indirectly support major pharmaceutical companies through chemicals, oil industries (fertilizer), and diesel production/ports; a very nationalist enterprise in an era of which America is the self-proclaimed champion of global free markets and force tariff removals. There are only two kinds of farmers: those selling their land and millionaires...there is little in-between in this industry...which also can no longer survive in a free market...commcercial farming has, in the words of a famous person, become 'too big too be allowed to fail.'","As the son of a farmer , I reluctantly agree with the author 's conclusion .

a way for people to get into popular restaurants,"True, this may be a non-issue relevant only to a small number of elite restaurants. But if the issue is the cost and difficulty imposed by no-shows (a real issue for restaurants of any level), it could be solved by a slightly different model: charge for a reservation, on either a flat or an auction basis, but then deduct that amount from the check. Essentially, require a deposit on the meal. Egalitarian concerns go away, since everyone pays the same for the reservation meal; and no-show problems are reduced, since the deposit increases incentive to keep your reservation, and restaurants keep the deposits for no-shows, to mitigate costs. Et Voila!","True , this may be a non - issue relevant only to a small number of elite restaurants .

restaurants,"It's easy to see why restaurant owners love tipping. The practice leaves them with very little work to do in incentivizing employees, holds wages down to an absolute minimum gives customers a sense of control and encourages them to consider themselves generous, even when they are merely paying the going rate for the meal. What's tragic is that some workers mysteriously believe that cash in hand is somehow worth more than cash on payday. The restaurant owners benefits from tipping come, in the end, at the worker's expense. Tipping is a form of corruption and would certainly not be tolerated in businesses like teaching, architecture, healthcare, journalism, etc. Tipping gives a financial reward to the stingy at the expense of the generous, undermines union organizing and dramatically decreases the transparency of compensation. The sooner tipping ends, the better for working people. It will be tough for restaurant owners and managers. They'll have to work much harder to keep workers motivated and, indeed, to keep them working at all, but, in the longer run, the service will be better, the work experience will be better and the dining experience will be better off for it.","It 's easy to see why restaurant owners love tipping .
