Somebody has got to pay, and it has to be the people who benefit from society, because there are no other sources. Bank interest is double taxed, and capital gains are and should be taxed. Contrary to the arguments that I see here, passive income is the most lethal of all to our social structure because it compounds wealth into the hands of a few lucky winners (sometimes just lucky enough to cheat), and deprives society, as a whole, of any chance to maintain a fair playing field for future generations. Capitalism is an amazing, but flawed human invention. Every once in a while capitalism and capitalists go awry. We are living in one of those times. We just need to fix that, and everything will be fine...........including the deficit.",0

It should be legal and under womens control as a sacrament or a temple of sexual expression. And women should have places to go too. Plus since it is expensive there should be clubs that allow sex play short of intercourse and a variety of options for members to mingle. There should be options to minister to the intimacy needy. There should be surrogates for teenagers and perhaps learner permits with sexual education. There should be confidential assistance for teenagers sexual issues, acceptable expression of parphilias and ways to explore without having actual sex. Much violence, abuse, substance abuse, breakup problems and stalking comes from limited options that produce fixations.

Consumer protest works, but not when it is a solo effort. A bit much self-promotion here. 2. This debate is about one word, ""natural."" Language is too complex for the debate to be about one word. The issue is can claiming in the name that something is not present. It defies logic to state in a product name that lemon is in the product when in fact there is no lemon at all. That is simply misleading (bold face lying). ""Lemon"" in common nomenclature is something that comes from the lemon plant, not it's laboratory produced analog. Isn't truth in advertising the issue? 3. My food slogan is ""I'm very careful about what I put in my mouth."" So that unfortunately means every label must be scrutinized.",1

x,37VHPF5VYEEOSIPYLFEUIESZX588C2,public preschool,"I would like to suggest an additional choice. If we are going to subsidize preschool or child care, why not also subsidize parents who want to stay home with their children but can't afford to? We are constantly being urged to copy European measures to provide care for children outside the home, but we are never urged to follow the example of Finland, France, Norway, Belgium and Austria by also providing parental home-care allowances. Why the selectivity? I am afraid it is because while feminism claims to oppose our tendency to hold the work of childcare in low regard - a tendency which predates second-wave feminism - it has done virtually nothing to correct that prejudice. Instead it supports an everybody-into-the-workforce ideology which in turn relies on the availability of underpaid childcare.",1

If people choose not to use tax-payer sponsored education for their kids, do the childless taxpayers have to shoulder the burden of educating their children anyway? Would the country be better off with everyone educating their own kids? If I pay less than my fair share of taxes, am I keeping my own money or stealing it from the country?

If his off-hours -- but very public and very controversial -- actions were deemed to affect his workplace efficiency, then his employer had a perfect right to fire him.

I grew up with a father who was a heavy smoker. Possibly as a result, I was given large doses of steroids (to which I became addicted) because I had asthma throughout much of my adolescence. I was also put on thyroid medication for seven years unnecessarily because, at that time, the measures for thyroid were faulty. So today I suffer from osteoporosis and so have adopted a diet rich in calcium. Fortunately, I am not too lactose intolerant and can handle milk products, unless I pick up a virus.

The ones that accept huge subsidies from the federal government? My guess is that the ones who are really upset are the large Agribusinesses that use hundreds of illegal laborers at a time. Many small farmers are succeeding with high quality locally raised crops. Here in central Massachusetts, where growing is a real challenge, the small farms are doing very well. Locally raised produce that doesn't need to be transported and stored at tremendous cost is inherently cheaper and better. In the past many solutions to the problem have been proposed, including permits to work temporarily in the US. All defeated. I think some people just like cheap labor and no accountability. Not to worry, though, the migrants are no longer flowing to the US and there are millions of unemployed Americans, so it will work itself out to the benefit of the farmers if we just keep destroying the economy.",0

Diesel cars are 50% of the cars on the road in Europe.

The SMART car has been in Canada for sometime, but in Canada it runs on a 3 cylinder diesel and gets over twice the mileage I get. But why isn't the diesel version of the Smart car in the U.S.? The clean diesel Smart cars of Canada and my VW Jetta both meet California emission standards.
