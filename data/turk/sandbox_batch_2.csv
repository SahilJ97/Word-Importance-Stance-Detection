veganism,"Dear Nina, with all due respect, one would wonder how the rest of the world survived tens of thousands of years, without the Western diet posited by you! It's worth exploring native (so called primitive) infant weaning practices. Almost every tradition has survived without a western Nestlé premix or infant formula or bottled/jar infant food. Where vegan or vegetarian diets are lacking, consider lentils and millets (example finger millet) which are rich in B vitamins and iron and also easily digestible and biologically available. Please don't dismiss vegan or vegetarian diets for infants so easily. There is a wealth of knowledge available in traditions of Asia, Far East, Africa, Near East, Middle East, you know the rest of the non Eurocentric world!","Dear Nina , with all due respect , one would wonder how the rest of the world survived tens of thousands of years , without the Western diet posited by you !

research papers,"I cannot remember a time when all the invited essays on a Room for Debate, by and large, agreed with each other. These times are lauded as the Age of Information. But the simple reality missing from the premise of this debate is having ACCESS to information is not the same as being able to USE information. A research paper, at its core, requires that information be: > obtained; > analyzed; then > utilized. How could this EVER become obsolete? Yes, it is demoralizing that too many students believe that Google relieves them of any obligation to actually acquire skills of investigation, evaluation, and synthesis or that experts like librarians are obsolete. However, when a graduate program's provides a list of companion articles for courses and then the library provides one-click access to each and every article, they both are complicit in contributing to their own obsolescence.","I can not remember a time when all the invited essays on a Room for Debate , by and large , agreed with each other .

israel,"Regardless of what other commenters think about Palestine and the Palestinians- some of it blatantly racist e.g. that Arabs are a violent people and therefore not worthy of U.S. support, some of it just historically ignorant- e.g. Arafat turned down a peace deal and therefore Palestinians are undeserving of a state forever after - the issue isn't Palestine v. Israel. The issue is whether the U.S. can be an impartial mediator in the dispute. And it cannot. The U.S., for better or for worse, wrongfully or rightfully, has a 'special relationship' with Israel that will always, always, always come first. Regardless of the current state of affairs, of who is on the 'wrong' or 'right' side of the latest iteration of the conflict, the U.S. is in Israel's corner first and the peace process's second. We therefore can never be a true mediator in this issue.","Regardless of what other commenters think about Palestine and the Palestinians- some of it blatantly racist e.g. that Arabs are a violent people and therefore not worthy of U.S. support , some of it just historically ignorant- e.g. Arafat turned down a peace deal and therefore Palestinians are undeserving of a state forever after - the issue is n't Palestine v.

women,"I compete in the Miss America pageant system. In two of my interviews last year, I was asked how I failed and how I overcame that failure. Not only does the Miss America Organization fuel confidence in young women and provides scholarship, but it prepares us for real-world job interviews, public speaking, and brings out the servants' heart in all of us. A huge part of the Miss America Organization is community service. Since 2007, when we first partnered with Children's Miracle Network, the women competing in the organization have raised over $8 million JUST for that one charity. Aside from that, we all have a personal platform that we are advocates for including prevention of diseases, standing up against bullying and breaking stereotypes and barriers that are presented against women. I can't speak for every pageant system, but Miss America is a non-profit organization that is made up by dedicated volunteers. Some incredible women have gone through that organization to go on to incredible careers and futures and a lot of them credit their success to the journey and experience they gained from competing in this program.","I compete in the Miss America pageant system .

sanctions,"The US embargo on Cuba only helps maintain the status quo in Cuba while being a self inflicted wound on the US, especially the Gulf States of Alabama, Louisianna and Mississippi. The embargo has throttled down major trade along the Mississippi affecting trade from New Orleans to Chicago. The lost trade and development is astronomical. We must remember that Cuba was one of our most important trading partners at the time the embargo was imposed. The embargo had a direct impact on the decline of southern economies. US policy is driven by emotion rather than any realistic policy that might bring about change.

special schools for the deaf,"Please note that many many comments in response to this article as well as the article itself sadly lacks an in depth understanding of Deaf people.

vacation,"I agree with the poster who said there's no one-size approach to this question. My ideal solution would be to take a vacation without the kids ~and~ the husband. Of course, you don't know my family.

a gamble,"it hilarious that the states scream for Casino's yet fear legalizing marijuana. Gambling destroys more families than marijuana ever did. Casino's prey far more on those who can least afford to gamble than it does in attracting the extremely wealthy to gamble away what they have in the same percentage terms. Know why ? Rich are rich for a reason, they did not gamble away their chance at success, wasting their money on a dream of striking it rich. Casino's pay terribly low wages for service persons. Casino's in the end cost society more than they can ever generate to the states or federal gov't. Casino's should as they always were be a destination resort to insure those that do gamble can at least afford it. I never saw a poor person at Atlantis in the Bahamas, or Aruba, I cannot say the same for Foxwoods, Atlantic City, or even Las Vegas. At one time Las Vegas was a destination resort, now it too exploits the poor more than taking from tourists I don't gamble, but I do enjoy watching people play, I don't enjoy watching them lose.","it hilarious that the states scream for Casino 's yet fear legalizing marijuana .
