veganism,"Just wanted to add that I went to a vegan dinner once in CA for people interested in joining the vegan lifestyle. The food was interesting and very chewy, to the point where my jaw hurt. The regular members were all very thin and did not look particularly healthy. I was mildly chastised by several members for wearing leather sandals and for having a leather bag. Leather is a no-no. My overall impression of the event and the people there was that it was like a zealous religious cult with very strict rules.","Just wanted to add that I went to a vegan dinner once in CA for people interested in joining the vegan lifestyle .

motherhood,"I adopted at 40 and have no regrets. But I do wish sometimes that I had the strength I used to have a decade back. A late child allowed me to enjoy my career, travel the world and see all kinds of late night movies/plays and do trekking and a lot of other stuff that a lot of my friends just could not do because they were stuck at home with their babies. So, yes - delaying a baby definitely worked for me. My friends are now sending their kids off to college while I'm still teaching addition n subtraction - true. But I'm a happier person and a better mom because I'm not resenting my kid as the reason for not fulfilling my career ambitions or not having enjoyed my own space.","I adopted at 40 and have no regrets .

grade colleges,"It's good to see that the educational bureaucracy is falling into line behind this proposal. Laggards and doubters can surely be brought around by the prospect of generous federal grants to develop ratings systems models and protocols and test them on various institutional cohorts. The primary goal of education is, of course, is to produce uniform and interchangeable cogs for the economic machine, so that it will hum smoothly and predictably. A college ratings system will extend the infallible testing paradigm into whole new realms, taking our country to heretofore unimaginable new heights of sameness. The wise sages at the Business Roundtable and the Gates Foundation will love it. The great successes of the primary and secondary school testing models can now be applied to the entire educational system. Victory is almost in our grasp.","It 's good to see that the educational bureaucracy is falling into line behind this proposal .

illegal labor,Of course their salaries should be raised. But this should be separated from the discussion about legality. Salaries should be raised and only legal workers should be employed.

airline industry,"Personally I think airlines don't care about any of their workers. They most certainly don't care about the flying public/customer. This is reflected in the faces of all who are shoehorned and buckled into tiny seats. Like all other jobs today we humans are disposable workers, flight attendants included. I can handle a surly or neglectful attendant on occasion for it is a tough, demanding position but we can't let the airlines cut corners on their pilots. This worries me tremendously having worked for the airlines in the past. These mostly highly trained professionals are being abused and not paid decently. Don't get me wrong cabin crews are important but the person in the cockpit can not be marginalized or treated poorly. I think we can all agree that safe, happy and well rested and trained pilots are crucial to the business.","Personally I think airlines do n't care about any of their workers .

casinos,"Wealth is not money. Wealth is hamburgers, cars, buildings, all the things we need to live. To build casino's that simply transfer money from one person to a establishment is not creating anything. It is simply taking advantage of the frailties of the human condition to rob people. A caution however... everything has consequences, to build more Casinos is to invite more debt in the terms of social payments to the newly poor who have dumped their life savings into these black holes. The misery caused is also a real effect but our government seems to to be oblivious to misery caused. It seems to work to perfect it.","Wealth is not money .

your cat,"Completely inaccurate. The first sentence I can see from the Facebook link alone is bull. I won't waste my time reading the rest. ""Excessive dog breeding, ear cropping and tail docking are more abusive than declawing a pet cat"". Clearly the author doesn't understand what goes on in a declaw surgery. They're amputating the toe completely so the cat has to walk on the phlanges that are NOT meant to be completely weight-bearing. A dog getting its ears or tail docked I agree is cruel but nowhere near worse than a cat being declawed. Last time I checked a dog's tail and ears aren't what bear all of their body weight when standing. Not to mention the ears are soft tissue that heals over time and has nothing to do with the dog's skeleton. The tail does involve the skeleton but would not have an effect on the dog's overall well-being once done. And excessive dog breeding? That has nothing to do with surgical procedures done on a dog or cat. That's a completely separate issue altogether. Ridiculous article.","Completely inaccurate .

their children,"Growing up, I was always a high academic achiever. Still, I always asked my parents to proofread my work before turning it in. Those evenings in which my parents edited at my side turned out to improve my writing so much more than my teachers ever could. That one-on-one, painstakingly specific instruction taught me that active voice is preferable to passive and that there is a difference between formal, academic essays and casual, creative writing. Just because my parents helped me craft an essay didn't mean I didn't learn to become a better writer from that experience, and it certainly didn't make me dependent on them throughout my life. My younger sister, on the other hand, resisted their help, preferring to do her work alone. She became an exceptional writer and went to a great school. In the end, each kid has different needs. I don't think you can make a blanket statement saying ""all parents should do this"" or ""all homework help (or homework, for that matter) is counterproductive.""","Growing up , I was always a high academic achiever .

home schoolers,"Although I have no idea what studies show about home schooled kids, I do know that, having hired two of them, my impression is not favorable. Both were prima donnas who spent a lot of time complaining about work rules, who thought that they should be able to change work processes to suit them, and who resorted to crying and making scenes to try and get their way with co-workers. The public school system was established primarily as a benefit to society, not just the individual child. That is why we all pay taxes to the schools whether we have kids or not. If people want to take their children out, so be it -- but they still still have their obligation to support the schools.","Although I have no idea what studies show about home schooled kids , I do know that , having hired two of them , my impression is not favorable .

a tax break,"May I ask why a Federal Tax Credit is requested for those who home-school when education is a State-based function. States, counties, cities collect the property, sales, and other local taxes and assessments which fund the local public schools, libraries, playgrounds, parks, and many other community-based educational and cultural resources. I am puzzled that those who so ardently shout for the preservation of States Rights seem to be inviting the Federal Government into their home to demand oversight of their children's school curriculum and evaluate their performance. Am I missing something here or is there some kind of shuffle going on. I can see the validity of home-schooling or private schooling families requesting an allowance from local and state taxes where control of the costs and expenses for the vast majority of education resides. No nanny Federal Government for those who choose to do things their own way. And no Federal subsidy for their right to choose.","May I ask why a Federal Tax Credit is requested for those who home - school when education is a State - based function .

home-schoolers,"It does not matter that parents who home school may pay just as much into the school system as other families.

more serious crime,"Citations rather than arrests for minor crimes still make a lot of sense. But I'm not sure that would have helped here---the guy who commits the same crimes over and over, and resists arrest, is likely to fail to appear in court, and then you're stuck with arrest as a solution. Ultimately, if the perceived price to the individual of defying or ignoring the law is lower than the benefits they think they get from breaking the law, you have a big problem.","Citations rather than arrests for minor crimes still make a lot of sense .

As a teacher friend of mine once observed to me, exceptional children (students) comprise a very small percentage of any given class that he taught and that most students were average or a bit above average in their intellectual abilities and creative talents. A small percentage was below average. Is it any wonder we have raised generations of children who think that they are special, entitled and dependent on mood altering drugs. It is perfectly okay to be a plain ordinary good human being. In our present economic conditions most of us know or are aware of twenty somethings of various skill levels and educational achievements who have moved back home with their parents because they cannot find employment.

israel,I am simply stunned that the pro Israeli lobby does not grasp that Americans do not want to fight a war with Iran in support of a right wing Israeli government that simply does what it wants to do regardless of the consequences.

Simply stated I do not want my son to die in a war created by Netanyau to support his radical agenda. If Israel strikes at Iran before the election to force Obama's hand their will be an anti Israeli firestorm in the US. The main casualty will be Isreali US relations which may never recover.

overcrowding,"I used to teach Quantitative Reasoning. One of the databases we used to analyze was birth rate by country. That was over ten years ago, but it showed my students how high birth rates would become unsustainable in small countries without similar economic growth rates. The same countries we identified as problems back in that course are in the center of the refugee and problematic youth crises now. Just divide the birth rate (in percentage) into 70 and you get the population doubling time. How can an economically stressed country every imagine handling the doubling of its population in less than a generation? It doesn't make any sense to talk about overall wealth in the world, either, when people have no realistic prospect of any future access to it without migrating.

public preschool,"There is a similar system in the UK. All children aged 3 and upwards are entitled to 15 hours of preschool / nursery per week. This ensures that children are well-socialized and exposed to group environments before they start school, which is at the age of 4 / turning 5 in the UK. Another option for the US would be to just lower the school starting age. In my state, California, the cut-off date for children starting kindergarten is September 1st. As my son's birthday is in October, this means he will be almost 6 years old before he is in any kind of group learning or social environment (unless we decide to put him preschool of course). Why not lower the kindergarten age by a year instead of starting a preschool program? The sooner children learn to deal with a group environment and the joy of learning, the better.","There is a similar system in the UK .

As my son 's birthday is in October , this means he will be almost 6 years old before he is in any kind of group learning or social environment ( unless we decide to put him preschool of course ) . Why not lower the kindergarten age by a year instead of starting a preschool program ? The sooner children learn to deal with a group environment and the joy of learning , the better .",0
marijuana,"If you'd like to call marijuana a gateway drug, then you'll have to include tobacco and alcohol, too.... also indicators. Why don't lets focus our attention on solving real problems. This country doesn't have a marijuana problem, and just because there's a correlation between people addicted to harder drugs like alcohol and painkillers who also smoke pot doesn't make it pot cause. If we have time and energy and resources, let's work on the drugs we know are dangerous and lets work on general education about addiction. Diverting our attention and energies from epidemic-level heroin use, for example, or from teaching about addiction generally to instead focus on marijuana specifically is worse than pointless, it will cost lives.","If you 'd like to call marijuana a gateway drug , then you 'll have to include tobacco and alcohol , too .... also indicators .

schoold,"I'm in my Junior year in High School, and I take the hardest courses my school offers. I average 8 hours of homework every night with 6-7 hours of school in a day. I also work about 3 hours a day. I do not sleep. I spend most of my weekend sleeping, until Sunday where I do 12 hours of homework. I love school and I love learning, and I'd argue the school day needs to be extended. The teachers do not have enough time to teach us all we need to know, especially in AP courses.

medical websites,I just finished seeing a patient after her second attack of pancreatitis over two years. Her most recent attack was uncomplicated and an ultrasound showed a 1.8cm gallstone and multiple small gallstones only in the gallbladder. The bile ducts had no stones and there was not ultrasound abnormality of the pancreas. She had done her internet research and was adamantly convinced that she should never have her gallbladder removed. She somehow learned from the internet that the gallbladder provides necessary vitamins and nutrients and it should not be removed. I am not a gallbladder surgeon and I explained to her how the stones in the gallbladder were the cause of her pancreatitis and the treatment and prevention of more attacks is to electively remove the gallbladder surgically. I explained that drug or diet treatment to dissolve her stones is not usually successful and that there is no absolute need to keep her gallbladder for nutritional reasons. She immediately became defensive and clung even more to her miss-information. I also use the internet to diagnose things. But I stick to ordering replacement parts and fixing household objects.,I just finished seeing a patient after her second attack of pancreatitis over two years .
